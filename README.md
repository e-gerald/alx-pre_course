Hi, I'm Gerald, a student in the ALX Software Engineering program. 
I love computers and all things automation. 
I've tried my hands on a few programming languages like Python and C but I haven't delved as deeper as I'll want. 
I joined the program to achieve that mastery and can't wait to be a full-stack software engineer.
